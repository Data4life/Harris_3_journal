An array is used to contain an object

the code is:
int[] something = new int[];

the code is:
String[] something = new String[];

the code is:
Boolean something = new boolean[];

the code is:
double[] something = new double[];

You would:
int[] something = new int[0]
something[0] = 42;

String something = "bob";

It creates a string called dessert and gives it a value of 3

It creates a string called dessert and changes its value of "rice pudding, pan dulce, bunuelos"

One replaces and one gives a value
