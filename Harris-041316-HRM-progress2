Day 1: 1 - 13

What was the biggest challenge overall?
Multiplying the numbers by each other. 

What did you learn about how to approach problem solving?
I learned to  predict the most complicated code and then shorten it down.

What did you learn about how to approach program and algorithm design?
I learned to use everything that is given to me in the level. If there is space on the floor, then I should use it. 
Even though this probably isnâ€™t always true, I seem to do better with the space.

What did you learn about program optimization?
It can make this game easier. It is also a better way to understand how to use less code while coding our games.
