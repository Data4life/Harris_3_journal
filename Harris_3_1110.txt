You can track hp by creating a counter for HP(); and you can set that counter to 100 for example and everytime you get hurt you can subtract (HP--) a certain amount.

You can create a variable that prints out what you have done. and everytime you beat something it adds a new line to your "quest log", and in the same way for items in a "bag".
