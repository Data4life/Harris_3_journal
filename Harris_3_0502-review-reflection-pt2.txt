An array is a container object thats holds a fixed number of values of a specific type

static String[][] myArray = new String[a][b];

int[][] myArray = new int[5][5];

int[][][] myArray = new int[5][5][5];

array[5] = 10;

while (values) {
	if(values) {

	}
}

A wile loop is helpful when you want something to achieve or complete something.

main();

So that when the user imputs a capital letter and you expect a lower case letter it converts it to a lower case letter.


Put everthing having to do with the movement in one method and everything having to do with intersection in another

The input the player puts in.
