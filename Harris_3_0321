His game was good, his game did not have any enemies. He did not have a second level but on the second try on the level it was harder. And he did not change the speed and health potion picture.

His game was my favorite. His was a side scroller. The game transitions were nice, I like this hidden levels. But he did not have a “press delete if you get stuck to kill yourself” on the beggining screen. Although sometimes his game would break when you stepped on one block instead of two or more.
Jacob
There was music, but their was only one level. Also he made his own orb.
