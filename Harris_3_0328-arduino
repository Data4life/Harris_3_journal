There is no main class in the arduino program. The only classes there are in arduino are void classes.
If I was going to make any adjustments I would adjust the light sensor to be more sensitive.
a positive / voltage, and negative ground
verify
everything up to light sensor (I wasn't here the first day)
a light sensor changing the light produced by a led and the amount of noise ina buzzer.
